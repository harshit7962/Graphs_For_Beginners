The traversal here is indeicated by blue arrows...

## Applications of Breadth First Search:
1) Shortest Patah in an Unweighted Graph
2) Crawlers in Search Engines
3) Peer to Peer Networks
4) Social Networking Sites
5) In Garbage Collection (Cheney's Algorithm)
6) Cycle Detection in a graph
7) Ford Fulkerson Algorithm
8) Broadcasting
