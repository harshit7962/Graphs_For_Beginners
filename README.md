# Graphs_For_Beginners
Graphs are non-linear data-structure without hierarchy that are used to represent relationships between components...
There are two types of graphs:
1) **Undirected Graph:** Graphs where edges don't have any particular direction and the edge (v1,v2) is same as (v2,v1)...
2) **Directed Graphs:** Graphs where edges have a particular direction and the edge (v1,v2) implies a path from v1 to v2, and not vice-versa...

A graph can be represented using an adjacency matrix or an adjacency list.

## Applications of DFS:
1) Cycle Detection
2) Topological Sorting
3) Strongly Connected Components
4) Solving Maze and Similar Puzzles
5) Path Finding
