# Dijkstra's Algorithm
Given a graph and a source vertex, dijkstra's algorithm is used to find the shortest parth from the source vertex to all other vertices in the graph...
The idea here is similar to Prim's MST Algorithm, but instead of simply taking the minimum edge, here we take edge which will give us minimum out of all the possible edges...

## Algorithm:
1) Create a set to keep track of vertices that are included in shortest tree.
2) Assign distane value to all the vertices as infinte to all the other vertices and 0 to source vertex initially.
3) While all the vertices are not included in our shortest-path tree:
    * Pick a vertex u which is not present in our set, and which has minimum distance value...
    * Include u in our set...
    * Update the distance value of all the adjacent vertices of u. This is called as relaxation funtion. We update the distancce only if the current distance of the adj vertex is greater than sum of current vertex and distance btn current vertex and adj vertex...
4) Finally, we return our distance vector...
