# Kahn's Algorithm for Topological Sorting
<p>Topological sorting using Kahn's algorithm for Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAG) is a linear ordering of
vertices such that for every directed edge <i>uv</i>, vertex <i>u</i> comes before <i>v</i> in the ordering.</p>
Topological sorting for a graph is not possible if it is not a Directed Acyclic Graph...

## Algorithm
1) Find In-Degree of each vertex and store it in an auxiliary array.
2) Create a queue, q (for Breadth First Traversal)
3) Add all the nodes with 0 indegree vertices to the q
4) while q is not empty, pop an element from q and print it...
5) Also for every adjacent v of u, reduce indegree of v and if indegree becomes 0, add it to the q...

### Example:

* In this graph, we first print 0 and 1, as their indegrees are 0 each...
* Also, we reduce in degrees of 2,3 and 4 by 1 each as they are directly connected with 0 and 1...
* Since, in degree of 2 and 4 now becomes 0, we add them to queue...
* Next, we print 2 and 4 from q...
* Next, 5 and 3 are connected to 2 and hence we reduce their indegree by 1, and it becomes 0 for both, hence they are added to the queue...
* Finally, we print the remaining to vertex...

**Note that there can be more than topological ordering of a graph:**
For example, for the same graph, one of the ordering can be: 1 0 4 2 3 5
