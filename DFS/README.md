Here, we can see that we firstly traveresed the branch along the lines of A-B-C-D and then went through next neighbour of A, that is E and traveresed along the lines of E-F-G.

## Applications of DFS:
1) Cycle Detection
2) Topological Sorting
3) Strongly Connected Components
4) Solving Maze and Similar Puzzles
5) Path Finding
